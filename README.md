# Zywie_Rel1.0
Repository for managing our code for Release 1
Let's start adding our files to this repository. For now I have added a company called Zywie Technologies and Anuj and Zohaib as the other users. I have added only our Gmail ids to this repository. Once, we are comfortable working with Github, in a day or so, I will add Madhu too.
